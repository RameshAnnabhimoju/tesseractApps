    testimonial: `“ We’ve been using TesseractApp for over a year now, and it’s completely transformed the way we manage our NDIS business. Before Tesseract, we were juggling multiple systems just to handle rostering, billing, compliance, and staff training. It was time-consuming, costly, and inefficient.
Tesseract brings all of these functions together in one easy-to-use platform. It’s streamlined our operations, improved our workflow, and made it much easier to stay on top of everything. The team behind it, especially Kranthi and Rev, have been incredibly supportive — always responsive, open to feedback, and committed to helping us get the most out of the system.
 If you're an NDIS provider looking to simplify your processes, reduce costs, and avoid the stress of managing multiple tools, I highly recommend Tesseract. It’s been a game-changer for our team and our business. ”

Strong data security isn’t a luxury; it’s essential for compliance, service continuity, and, most importantly, client trust.",

      "Cyberattacks targeting the healthcare and disability sectors are rising. In July 2024, for example, a ransomware attack on prescription service MediSecure exposed the health and personal data of approximately 12.9 million Australians. Alarming figures show that 41% of Australian healthcare organisations experienced a cyberattack in 2023. These breaches can compromise privacy, disrupt care delivery, and result in serious regulatory and reputational consequences.",
