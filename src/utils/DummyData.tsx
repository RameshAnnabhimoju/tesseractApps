      "Protecting Participant Data: Why Security Matters for NDIS and Care Providers",
    description: ` Every day, disability support and aged care providers collect
            sensitive information — including health records, personal details,
            and care plans — that participants trust us to protect. Strong data
            security isn't a luxury; it's essential for compliance, service
            continuity, and, most importantly, client trust.`,

    description: `Australia’s NDIS (National Disability Insurance Scheme) is evolving at pace. By March 2025, the scheme supported over 717,000 active participants — a 3.5% increase in just one quarter. This rapid expansion creates significant operational, compliance, and workforce challenges for NDIS providers.`,

    description: `Many NDIS providers still build rosters by hand — using
            spreadsheets, whiteboards or group chats. It feels simple and
            "free". But the hidden costs add up fast. Every week, managers lose
            hours fixing mistakes. Shifts get double-booked. Overtime blows out
            budgets. Simple slip-ups mean under-claimed hours or overpayments.

    description: `NDIS service providers rely on having their operations staffed 
    properly. But too many organizations don’t realize how much bad workforce management 
    can rip into their bottom line. It’s easy to see where the money is being spent in 
    the form of staffing hours, but the hidden costs associated with overtime, absence, 
    compliance, and the negative impact on reputation are costing the providers out of

In July 2024, for example, a ransomware attack on prescription service MediSecure exposed the health and personal data of approximately 12.9 million Australians. Alarming figures show that 41% of Australian healthcare organisations experienced a cyberattack in 2023.
