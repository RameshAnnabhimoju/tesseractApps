            On August 8–9, 2025, the TesseractApps team had the honour of
            joining the Sydney Disability & WorkAbility Expo, where the air was
            alive with connection, innovation, and the shared commitment that
            drives the NDIS community.
          </p>

          <p>
            Those two days gave rise to moments we won’t forget, as we conversed
            directly with NDIS providers, support coordinators, participants,
            and sector leaders—each focused on refining care and boosting
            operational excellence across the country.

              This expo renewed our purpose at TesseractApps: to provide NDIS
              providers with the technology they need to overcome obstacles and
              elevate the standard of support. We will continue driving fresh
              ideas and partnerships so the sector can advance in an
              increasingly fast-paced landscape.
