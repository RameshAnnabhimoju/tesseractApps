            Protecting Participant Data: Why Security Matters for NDIS and Care
            Providers
          </h1>

            Every day, disability support and aged care providers collect
            sensitive information — including health records, personal details,
            and care plans — that participants trust us to protect. Strong data
            security isn't a luxury, it's essential for compliance, service
            continuity, and, most importantly, client trust.
          </p>

          <p>
            Cyberattacks targeting the healthcare and disability sectors are
            rising. In July 2024, for example, a ransomware attack on
            prescription service <strong>MediSecure</strong> exposed the health
            and personal data of approximately{" "}
            <strong>12.9 million Australians</strong>. Alarming figures show
            that{" "}
            <strong>
              41% of Australian healthcare organisations experienced a
              cyberattack in 2023
            </strong>
            . These breaches can compromise privacy, disrupt care delivery, and
            result in serious regulatory and reputational consequences.

            <h2 className="section-title">Why It Matters</h2>
            <p>
              Data breaches are no longer hypothetical — they are a lived
              reality for care providers across Australia. For NDIS and aged
              care organisations, protecting participant data is not only a
              compliance issue under the NDIS Practice Standards, but a moral
              obligation. At Tesseract Apps, we combine the convenience of the
              cloud with the rigour of enterprise-level security to give
              providers peace of mind and help them focus on what matters most,
              delivering quality care.
