        To sign in for shifts, geolocation services must be enabled on your
        device. You will only be able to sign in if you are within a 400-meter
        radius of the assigned shift location. Additionally, once signed in,
        your location will be tracked at every 100-meter interval to monitor
        your presence at the location during the shift.

        You may manage your geolocation settings through your device. However,
        disabling location services will restrict certain features, including
