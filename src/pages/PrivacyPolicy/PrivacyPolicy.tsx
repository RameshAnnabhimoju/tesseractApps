      <div className="text privacy-policy-text">
        To sign in for shifts, geolocation services must be enabled on your
        device. You will only be able to sign in if you are within a 400-meter
        radius of the assigned shift location. Additionally, once signed in,
        your location will be tracked at every 100-meter interval to monitor
        your presence at the location during the shift.
